  <h2>The Story of the DHF Tech Center:</h2>

				<h3>Rec<span>2</span>Tech</h3>
				<p>The South Baltimore Recreation Center was slated by the Mayor of Baltimore to close it's doors in 2012. The Digital Harbor Foundation, however, had a vision of transformation through which an old rec center could become a tech center. The process of transforming the space, dubbed Rec2Tech, gave birth to the Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center. Since our launch in January 2013, we have seen the ideas born here spread throughout the country as other similar spaces seek to reinvigorate their offerings to the community. <!-- Read all about the transformation by visiting <a href="http://www.rec2tech.org" target="_blank">rec2tech.org</a> --> </p>

				<h3>Mega<span> LAB</span></h3>
				<p>High-school aged students interested in tech fields such as web development, mobile development, digital fabrication, and cyber security come daily to the MegaLab where they work with <em>mentors</em> and <em>tech coaches</em> on individually-identified projects. Students who have developed skills are then able to participate in the <a href="http://www.stemengine.org/" target="_blank">STEM Engine</a> workforce development program.</p>

				<h3>Nano<span> Lab</span></h3>
				<p>The NanoLab, serving children in grades Pre-K through 5th grade, develops students' STEM abilities through creation, cooperation, collaboration, organization, and digital literacy. The NanoBots (our students) explore a variety of themes and activities, as individuals and groups, in a creative project-based learning environment.</p>

				<h3>Pro<span> Lab</span></h3>
				<p>In response to overwhelming demand from students for opportunities related to audio and video production, DHF has outlined plans and space to create a Pro(duction) Lab for recording and mixing purposes. The lab is projected to open by the end of 2013. In the mean time, students are already working on DJ and mixing skills in the MegaLab. </p>

				<h3>Fab<span> Slam</span></h3>
				<p>Ruthie BenDor is a front-end developer and designer who worked for GLAD and MassEquality and founded a 100+ member user group for the ExpressionEngine CMS. As a Fellow, Ruthie and the Santa Cruz, Calif. team collaborated closely with Economic Development Coordinator Peter Koht to make it easier for entrepreneurs to start local businesses. The resulting tool, <a href="http://opencounter.cityofsantacruz.com/" target="_blank">OpenCounter</a>, walks an aspiring small business owner through the complicated zoning codes, forms, and fees needed to apply for a business permit ? and enables them to apply directly online. Ruthie's now a design technologist at fuseproject.</p>

				<h3>Mobile<span> Slam</span></h3>
				<p>Jesse Bounds is a software engineer with a decade of experience, including leading the development of Fluent, the first highly optimized news aggregator and reader for the iPhone. As a Fellow on the Chicago team, he built tools to help cities make service requests ? like broken streetlights or potholes ? easier to manage and understand. Now Chicagoans can go to <a href="http://servicetracker.cityofchicago.org/" target="_blank">311 ServiceTracker</a> and see the status of their requests throughout the process, as easily as they track packages through FedEx. He is now an engineer at Pivotal Labs in San Francisco.</p>
